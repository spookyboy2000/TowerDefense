#### The Goal is to Defeat 10 waves of enemy's without dying (u die by letting 10 enemy's shoot at ur base).

# Why i made it
#### I made the game for a school project in my second year. you had to make a TowerDefense game with some things that u had to have in ur game like u had to have multiple towers and had to make sure that enemies have a goal to attack something. U also had to make sure u could see a start and an end. They also wanted Waves and a shop system in the TowerDefense. With the shop u have to be able to buy the towers. And the last thing u needed was 2 mechanics u thought of urself.
# My opinion
#### I had fun working on this project although i had my fair share of troubles, like not using GitHub :grin:. By far the worst thing i could have done cause that made me loose my whole project in the end. But either way i learned alot thanks to this project.
# What did i learn
#### That using GitHub is a must and i will never not use it it could save u alot of time incase u loose ur game or something else.
#### I became better at C# and Learned how to keep going even if something goes wrong or doesnt go your way.
